# JKL + TACHYONS

A light-weight Jekyll v1.0 blog scaffolding that's ready to deploy after setting up one
config. Still under development. Pull requests encouraged && accepted.

# Get Started
```
git clone https://github.com/tachyons-css/jekyll-tachyons.git
cd jekyll-tachyons
npm install
npm start
```
That should do the trick. More verbose explanations below.

You'll also want to open another tab in terminal and run
```
jekyll serve --watch
```

This will build the site.

This sets up a jekyll server for dev on port 4000. Site is regenerated everytime you save a file.
NOTE: Changing _config.yml will require a restart of the jekyll server to see changes.
To restart server, go to terminal tab that server is running in then press
```
ctrl+C â‡§  enter
```


## Notes
Example posts are in jkl/_posts/
There are two layouts, one for posts, one for other pages. Layouts are stored, creatively,
in jkl/_layouts/ Folders that begin with an underscore are not copied over to
_site.
